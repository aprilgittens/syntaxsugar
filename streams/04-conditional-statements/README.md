**Stream 4:** Conditional Statements

**Status:** Scheduled

**Date:** February 19, 2026

**Video:** Coming Soon

## 📋 Overview

Learn how to write programs that make decisions! Conditional statements let your code respond differently based on data—checking values, comparing information, and choosing different paths. This is where programs start feeling intelligent.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- How to use if statements to run code conditionally
- Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Using else to handle alternative cases
- Chaining multiple conditions with elif
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- Common conditional logic mistakes and how to fix them
- Using AI to debug and understand complex conditions

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Completed [Stream 3](streams/03-basic-opeators) (basic operators)
- Understanding of variables and basic data types
- Familiarity with True and False boolean values

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Part 1: Basic Conditionals

- What is a conditional statement?
- The `if` statement syntax
- Why indentation matters in Python
- Writing conditions that evaluate to `True` or `False`

### Part 2: Comparison Operators

- `==` (equal) vs `=` (assignment)
- `!=` (not equal)
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
- Comparing numbers and strings
- Common comparison mistakes

### Part 3: Else and Elif

- Using `else` for alternative outcomes
- The `elif` statement for multiple conditions
- Order matters: first true condition wins
- When to use `if` vs `elif` vs `else`

### Part 4: Logical Operators

- Combining conditions with `and`
- Using `or` for "either/or" logic
- Reversing conditions with `not`
- Building complex conditional logic

### Part 5: AI-Assisted Debugging

- Using AI to understand logic errors
- Asking AI to trace through conditions
- Getting help simplifying nested conditionals
- Learning common conditional patterns

### Part 6: Common Mistakes & Fixes
- Using `=` instead of `==`
- Forgetting the colon
- Indentation errors
- Wrong condition order
