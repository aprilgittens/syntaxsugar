# Stream 2: Variables and Data Types

**Status:** [Scheduled](https://youtube.com/live/btz9Ruo4p6M?feature=share)

**Date:** January 12, 2026

**Video:** Coming Soon

## 📋 Overview

Learn the foundation of Python programming: how to store data in variables and work with different types of data. This is where real coding begins! You'll write programs that store information, do calculations, and combine different types of data.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What variables are and why we need them
- The four basic Python data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- How to check what type your data is
- Converting between different data types
- Using AI to understand and fix type errors
- Best practices for naming variables

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Completed [Stream 1](streams/01-environment-setup) (environment setup)
- Python and VS Code installed
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) configured (optional but recommended)

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Part 1: Variables

- What is a variable?
- Creating variables with `=`
- Naming rules and conventions
- Updating variable values
- Using variables in calculations

### Part 2: Data Types

- **Strings (`str`)**
- **Integers (`int`)**
- **Floats (`float`)**
- **Booleans (`bool`)**

### Part 3: Working with Types

- Using `type()` to check data types
- Type conversion: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `bool()`
- Why types matter
- Common type errors and how to fix them

### Part 4: AI-Assisted Learning Example
- Asking AI about type errors
- Asking AI about naming best practices

### Part 5: Code Examples

All code from this stream is in the [`code/`](code) folder:

- [variables.py](code/variables.py) - Basic variable creation and usage
- [strings.py](code/strings.py) - Working with text
- [numbers.py](code/numbers.py) - Integers and floats
- [booleans.py](code/booleans.py) - True/False values
- [type_errors.py](code/type-errors.py) - Common mistakes and fixes
- [conversions.py](code/conversions.py) - Converting between types
- [types_mistakes.py](code/types_mistakes.py) - Common mistakes

### Part 6: Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Quotes around numbers
- Forgetting quotes on strings
- Type mixing
- Using reserved words
