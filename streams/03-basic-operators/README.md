# Stream 3: Basic Operators

**Status:** Scheduled

**Date:** February 17, 2026

**Video:** Coming Soon

## 📋 Overview

Learn how to make Python perform calculations, compare values, and combine logic. You'll master the three essential types of operators—arithmetic, comparison, and logical—going from basic math to building compound conditional statements that power real decisions in your code.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- The seven arithmetic operators and when to use each one
- How to compare values and get True/False results
- Combining conditions with logical operators (and, or, not)
- Operator precedence and why parentheses matter
- The difference between `=` and `==`
- Using AI to debug operator mistakes and understand logic errors

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Completed [Stream 2](streams/02-variables-and-data-types) (variables and data types)
- Understanding of variables and the four basic data types
- Python and VS Code installed
- [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat) configured (optional but recommended)

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Part 1: Arithmetic Operators

- Addition (`+`), Subtraction (`-`), Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`) vs Floor Division (`//`)
- Modulus (`%`)
- Exponentiation (`**`)
- Operator precedence (order of operations)
- When to use parentheses for clarity

### Part 2: Comparison Operators

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`
- Understanding that comparisons return booleans

### Part 3: Logical Operators

- `and` - both conditions must be True
- `or` - at least one condition must be True
- `not` - flips True/False
- Combining multiple conditions
- Logical operator precedence

### Part 4: AI-Assisted Learning

- Using AI to understand operator precedence
- Debugging `=` vs `==` mistakes
- Building complex logical conditions with AI help
- Understanding modulus with practical examples

### Part 5: Common Mistakes & Fixes

- Using `=` instead of `==`
- Forgetting operator precedence
- Mixing up `and`/`or` logic
- Division confusion (`/` vs `//`)
- Not understanding modulus
- Comparison chain confusion
