# Syntax Sugar 🐍

A beginner-friendly Python live stream series that teaches you both Python fundamentals **and** how to learn effectively with AI coding assistants.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

I don't just teach Python, I teach you how to learn Python using modern AI tools like GitHub Copilot!

 Every stream covers:

- One core Python concept
- How to use AI assistants to understand that concept deeper
- Live coding, mistakes, and real problem-solving

## 📺 Watch Live

- **Schedule:** Tuesdays & Thursday 11AM PT
